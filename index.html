      <h1>What Happened?</h1>
      <h3>So, a lot has happened ever since I took web design from my sophomore year. At the end of my junior year, I knew that Javascript was going to be a huge weakness of mine. Even if everything else was going well, Javascript was going to be a pain. Even this program doesn't have javascript. But before I could get to that, I had to get experience with java. Java would hopefully get more knowledge of JS due to them being very similar.</h3>
